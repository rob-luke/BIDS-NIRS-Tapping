## How to use this repository

I have used branches in this repository to describe the steps taken to convert this data to the BIDS format.
Using the GitHub interface you can select the branch you wish to view.
The branches are...

* [00-Raw-data](https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping/tree/00-Raw-data): Contains just the raw recordings
* [01-Raw-to-SNIRF](https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping/tree/01-Raw-to-SNIRF): Converts the original data to snirf, but not BIDS.
* [02-Raw-to-BIDS](https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping/tree/02-Raw-to-BIDS): Converts the original data to BIDS.
* [master](https://github.com/rob-luke/BIDS-NIRS-Tapping): Dataset in BIDS format.
